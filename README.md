# DAMNETS: A Deep Autoregressive Model for Generating Markovian Network Time Series

##Usage: 

    python run_exp -c "path_to_config file"
###Flags:
- -c "path_to_config". If this is left empty, it will attempt to use the config file generated by the last training run.
- -t indicates testing (i.e. sampling from a trained model).

See experiment_configs for example configuration files.

## Dependencies
The major dependencies are PyTorch with GPU enabled and Torch Geometric. Other dependencies can be found in the requirements file.
