# DAMNETS: A Deep Autoregressive Model for Generating Markovian Network Time Series

## Usage: 

    python run_exp -c "path_to_config file"
### Flags:
- -c "path_to_config". If this is left empty, it will attempt to use the config file generated by the last training run.
- -t indicates testing (i.e. sampling from a trained model).

See experiment_configs for example configuration files.

## Dependencies
The major dependencies are PyTorch 1.10 with GPU enabled and an appropriate Torch Geometric version. Other dependencies can be found in the requirements file.

## Brief Code Outline
The model code can be found in models/dmnets_gnn_mb.py. We train in parallel all subgraphs during the generation of $G_t$.
